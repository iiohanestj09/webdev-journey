    and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot 
    foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in 
    their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and 
    pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of 
    choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every 
    pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the 
    claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be 
    repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this 
    principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures 
    pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
